# aurposix

A (hopefullly) posix aur helper #!/bin/sh script 

Posix is difficult sometimes so I really don't know if its truly compliant but feel free to tell me.

## Installation

```BASH
$ git clone https://github.com/Paranoid-Pirate/aurposix.git
$ cd aurposix
$ chmod +x aurposix
```

Then you can just move aurposix to any of your `$PATH` directories

## Configuration

The only current configuration is changing the `$aurdir` variable at the beginning of the script  
It's meant to be edited to where you want aurposix to install to, the default directory is `~/.local/share/aurposix`
